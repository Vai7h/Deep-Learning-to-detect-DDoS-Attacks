# Website Phishing Detection Using Data Mining
#### About
The advancement of internet technology has greatly improved and facilitated daily living. The ease of employing smart devices to complete necessary transactions with a single click has increased. Convenience has a cost, and that cost is the threat posed by phishing websites. Website phishing is the unethical practice of building imitation websites that resemble real websites in order to steal sensitive data and information by posing as the real thing. Phishing attacks are on the rise and have grown to be a serious problem. To stop them, careful actions and precautions must be done. In this study, we examine the Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques currently in use and apply classification algorithms to find dangerous websites.

#### Methadology

We start by choosing specific attributes that make up each URL. The inputs are then trained and tested using the chosen features, with 80% of the dataset's samples being used for training and 20% being used for testing. Initializing the acquired training dataset and obtaining the corresponding URL characteristics. The suggested methodology uses three distinct algorithms: Random Forest, SVM, and a hybrid RF-SVM model. The accuracy of the output generated by each of the three models is then acquired using the testing data in order to assess their efficacy. To determine the authenticity of the URL, the categorization method that ultimately provides the highest accuracy is picked.
